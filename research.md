# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand how biomolecules (e.g., proteins and RNA) reach their functional native states starting from an astronomical number of random coil conformations.

Our goal is to primarily focused on discovering general principles that govern the folding of biomolecules. We use a combination of theoretical and computational strategies to answer several questions. In particular, we are interested in:
* RNA tertiary structure prediction
* RNA 3D structure evaluation
* Folding mechanisms of large RNA and DNA molecules
* Data-drive approaches to RNA computational biology
* AI-based RNA design

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**RNA coarse-grained modeling** We have developed a novel coarse-grained model for RNA tertiary structure prediction. The model can predict 3D structures, thermodynamical stability, and flexibility of RNAs including pseudoknots and junctions in monovalent and divalent ion solutions only from single sequence.


**RNA 3D structure evaluation** We have developed an all-atom distance-dependent statistical potential based on residue separation for RNA 3D structure evaluation, namely rsRNASP, which is composed of short- and long-ranged potentials distinguished by residue separation. The extensive examinations against available RNA test datasets show that rsRNASP has apparently higher performance than the existing statistical potentials for the realistic test datasets with large RNAs from structure prediction models, including the newly released RNA-Puzzles dataset, and is comparable to the existing top statistical potentials for the test datasets with small RNAs or near-native decoys. In addition, rsRNASP is superior to RNA3DCNN, a recently developed scoring function through 3D convolutional neural networks. 

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.
